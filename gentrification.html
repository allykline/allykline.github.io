	   		 According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, gentrification is "the process of renewal and rebuilding accompanying the influx of middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating areas that often displaces poorer residents." Gentrification has increasingly become a problem in the San Francisco Bay Area, as more and more "techies" migrate into the Bay for high-paying jobs, removing poor and low-income families from their homes.

   		 		<ul>
   		 		<li> 
   		 			In 2013, 48 percent of census tracts and more than 53 percent of low-income households lived in neighborhoods at risk of or already experiencing displacement and gentrification pressures. 
   		 		</li>
   		 		<li> 
   		 			Neighborhoods with rail stations, historic housing stock, and rising housing prices are especially at risk of losing low-income households.
   		 		</li>
   		 		<li>
   		 			Low income neighborhoods are not the only ones experiencing displacement pressures â€“ many higher income neighborhoods that still house low income households are also rapidly losing low income population.
   		 		</li>
   		 		<li>
   		 			The number of tracts at risk of displacement are 123% higher than the numbers already experiencing them, indicating that the transformation of the Bay Area will continue to accelerate.
