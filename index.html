			About Me~
		</h3>
		<p>
			Hi, my name is Ally Kline. I'm currently a junior at Saint Francis High School in Mountain View, California. I really enjoy working with technology and computers. I participated in the Girls Who Code 2016 Summer Immersion Program, where I learned Python, Arduino Robotics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my free time, I like to chill with my dog, Stewie, play video games, draw, and write. I would like to study CS in college and <i>hopefully</i> get to work in video/computer game design and creation. I'm also a pro binge watcher and tea enthusiast.
