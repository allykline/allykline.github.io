				<p> Scratch is a visual programming language. We used Scratch during the first week of the Girls who Code program to get a feel for computer programming. Below are two projects that I worked on in Scratch: Pig and the Jukebox. Clicking on the images will bring you to the two programs on the Scratch website, where you can see them in action alongside descriptions of what they do. </p>

				<p> This is a video of my group's Arduino UNO BoEBot dancing to the song "Bet on It" from <i> High School Musical 2. </i> During this portion of the program, we also wired LEDs to blink, programmed Piezo songs, and used the same robot as a whisker bot to detect walls and other obstacles. </p>

			Hi, I'm Ally (Aika) Kline. I'm currently a junior at Saint Francis High School in Mountain View, California. I really enjoy working with technology and computers. My talents include, but are not limited to: pro binge watching, tea drinking and enjoying, lip synching (especially in the shower), taking <i>very</i> artsy pictures, and rolling my R's. I participated in the Girls Who Code 2016 Summer Immersion Program, where I learned Python, Arduino Robotics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my free time, I like to chill with my dog, Stewie, play video games, draw, and write. I would like to study CS in college and <i>hopefully</i> get to work in video/computer game design and creation in the future.
